Hi, I created this game back in 1981-82. The dome city was just
something I put in to make it more interesting. I had intended
to do something cool toward the ending with the city but it was
completely unauthorized by Sega and I didn't want it to get
rejected by the testers so the city just gets larger for about
4 sectors and then stops changing. Also I didn't think anyone
would get that far!
