3.) About Striker.

    Striker is a  grapichs  oriented  game for	the IBM personal
    computer  series. In STRIKER the player is placed in control
    of a helicopter whose mission is to navigate various tunnels
    in	order to complete  five seperate missions  of skill. The
    game includes four sepearate skill levels which allows for a
    wide range of end user playing skill.Many other conveniences
    are  included in STRIKER. The user can center the screen and
    select color pallette. The user can also redefine the entire
    set of controlling	keys to his preference. High Scores, for
    the  four  different  skill  levels, may  be  displayed  and
    cleared. The  game	includes keys to  pause, toggle sound on
    and off, and  abort the game  at any  time. The program also
    allows a wide  variety of joysticks to be attached. By using
    the  Adjust  Joystick option  in the other	options menu the
    game  can handle joysticks of widely  varying resistance and
    a varying number of  buttons. STRIKER is designed to be easy
    to use. The program  on boot-up automatically determines the
    computer, PC,XT or Jr, that it is on and the number, if any,
    of joysticks attached to the computer. This makes setting up
    the software an option and not a requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.) How to play STRIKER.

    The mission in STRIKER is to navigate the helicopter through
    various tunnels and  successfully complete the five separate
    missions. Various  obstacles, including 5 different kinds of
    aliens, gun turrets and missles, try to keep the player from
    completeing  his  mission. The  player is given two means of
    defense: bombs and	bulletts. By using the bombs and bullets
    the player	may shoot down the various  aliens and obstacles
    for points. There  are  various fuel canisters located along
    ground.  These  canisters  give  no  point values but the do
    resupply the helicopter with fuel. The player  must resupply
    his  fuel  in the  later levels  or he  will run out of fuel
    due to the	manuevering  required in  the later levels. Once
    the  player has  completed the tunnel  he then must complete
    one of five missions. These missions are described in detail
    in	the section  entitled "Mission  Information". After  the
    game  is completed	the computer  checks to see if the score
    achieved is good  enough to be saved  to a high score  table
    and if so the user is asked  to input his name and the score
    is saved to one of the four separate score boards. One board
    is maintained for each skill level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.) Controlling Striker.


     This  section tells  how to control  the helicopter through
     the joystick and keyboard.

     Predefined Function Keys.
     -------------------------

     IBM PC and IBM PC XT and COMPATIBLES.

     CTRL-P	      - Pause game.
     CTRL-S	      - Toggle sound on and off.
     CTRL-NUM LOCK    - Pause game. (NOT ON PCjr.)
     CTRL-SCROLL LOCK - Abort Game. (NOT ON PCjr.)
     CTRL-B	      - Abort Game.

     IBM PCjr.

     CTRL-P	      - Pause game.
     CTRL-S	      - Toggle sound on and off.
     CTRL-B	      - Abort Game.

     Movement Contorl Keys.
     ----------------------

     There are four primary keys for movement. They are initally
     defined as the cursor control keys on the cursor pad.

			 ^
			 |
			 |  UP ARROW IS USED TO MOVE HELICOPTER UP
			 |
     LEFT KEY MOVES <---- ----> RIGHT KEY MOVES HELICOPTER RIGHT.
	      LEFT	 |
			 |
			 |
			 V  DOWN KEY MOVES HELICOPTER DOWN.


      These keys may be  pressed and released  at any  time. The
      helicopter will continue	to move in the	direction of the
      pressed key until  that key is released. More than one key
      can  be held  down to produce  diagonal  movement. If  two
      opposing	keys  are  held  down  moition	on  that axis is
      cancelled out.For example is the up and down keys are both
      held at the same	time the helicopter  will  level out and
      will  move  neither  up or down. The  ability  to hold and
      release  keys  makes  STRIKER easy  to  control  from  the
      keyboard.

      The SPACE BAR fires bullets from the helicopter.

      The "X" key drops bombs from the helicopter.

      The ESC key is defined as an alternative pause key.

      All of the above key  definitions can  be changed. See the
      section entitled "Other Options Menu".

    JOYSTICK CONTROL
    ----------------

     A	joystick  may be  used to control  the	helicopter.  The
     joystick may have up  to two buttons. If the  joystick  has
     only  one button that  button  will  fire	bullets. If  the
     joystick has 2 buttons  the first button will fire bulletts
     and the second  button will  drop bombs. When joysticks are
     activated the bomb  and fire keys and  well as the function
     keys are  still active  on the keyboard. This  allows users
     with one button to drop bombs from the keyboard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.) Aliens and Point Values.

    There  are five types  of aliens. Of these	five types  four
    can  be destroyed  and give point  values between  20 and 80
    points. The  fifth alien is a Space  Mine. The Space Mine is
    impervious	to attack  and cannot  be destroyed. However the
    Space Mine	is incapable  of firing  shots.  The player must
    avoid  the	Mine  beacause any  contact  with  the mine will
    destroy the helicopter. The  Gun Turret on the ground scores
    120  points.  The  Missiles  score	80  points  and the FUEL
    canisters score a fuel bonus but no point value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.) Mission Information.

    There are five Missions.
    They are:

   1.) PICK UP YOUR SPIES

       In  this  mission  you  must pick  up your spies. A small
       bunker will move  onto the screen with a landing pad. The
       player must land on the pad and wait for the spies to run
       out to the helicopter. If the player  takes off again and
       runs into a spy, the spy is  killed. If	all three  spies
       are  destoryed  the  player has	failed	his  mission and
       receives no bonus for the mission. The player may pick up
       only a  few of the  spies but this  will lower  the bonus
       points for the mission.

   2.) DROP OFF YOUR SPIES

       In this mission	you must drop off the spies picked up in
       mission one. If	all three  spies were  destroyed  in the
       first mission no building will scroll onto the screen and
       a message will be displayed informing the user that there
       is no mission to be completed beacause the spies were all
       killed. Otherwise a building  with 2 helipads will scroll
       onto the screen. The helipad on the left is for 2 men and
       the  helipad on the right  is for the last  spy. Once the
       spies are dropped off the mission is complete and a bonus
       will be awarded.

   3.) PICK UP CARGO

       In  this  mission  you must  pick up  three containers of
       cargo. In order	to pick up a  container you must land on
       it with	the helicopter level. The  landing  runner  must
       also be perfectly level with respect to the box. Once you
       land on the box it will be loaded into the helicopter. If
       you land improperly on a box the helicopter will explode.

   4.) RESCUE STRANDED PEOPLE

       In  this  mission  you must rescue people  from a burning
       building before the fire reaches the top of the building.
       If you  run into a  person on top  of the  building  that
       person  is  destroyed. If  a  person  is  on  top  of the
       the building when the fire reaches the top that person is
       destroyed. There  are three people  to rescue altogether.
       If  the helicopter  runs into the  building or  is on the
       building when the fire reaches the top it is destroyed.

   5.) DESTROY MISSILE FACTORY

       In  this  mission you must  destroy  the missile  factory
       before three missiles are  loaded onto the truck. You can
       bomb  the missile factory  to destroy it. There are three
       sections to the	missile  factory and  all three must  be
       bombed in order to destory the factory. However, the flow
       of missiles can be stopped by bombing either the truck or
       the converyor belt.

			       Scoring.

       The first time a mission is played it is worth a possible
       bonus of 1000 points. Each  mission  after that is  worth
       1000  points more. However, on  missions  1-4 points  are
       awarded on how successfully the mission was completed. In
       other words if the player resuces only 1 spy in mission 1
       he receives  25% of  the possible bonus or 250 points. If
       he rescues 2 he	recieves 50%  (or 500 points)  and if he
       rescues all 3 he receives 100% (or 1000 points). This  is
       the same for the  other three missions and is tied to the
       number of people, or in the case of mission the number of
       boxes, rescued or retreived.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.) Other Options Menu.

       These  menus  allow  you  to configure  STRIKER for  your
       praticular machine. The menus are as follows:


	Game Demonstration.

	 This is a prepetual running demonstration of STRIKER.

	Display High Scores.

	 This menu displayes the high score table for the current
	 skill level.

	Joystick Adjustment.

	 This menu  allows you to calibrate  STRIKER to  your own
	 set of  joysticks. The  computer will determine  whether
	 you have one or  two joysticks and if	you have only one
	 the computer will automatically select that joystick. If
	 you have two joysticks  the computer will  ask you which
	 one to use. The computer will	then ask how many buttons
	 are  on  the  joystick.  After  this  slowly rotate  the
	 joystick  around its  outer  edge. This  will	allow the
	 computer to determine	the resistance of your joysticks.
	 After this press return  and the  game will be set up to
	 use your joysticks.

	Adjust Keyboard

	 This option allows you  to choose the keys you will use
	 to play STRIKER. The  computer will ask for 6 different
	 keys: UP,  DOWN,  LEFT, RIGHT,  BOMB,	FIRE BULLET, and
	 PAUSE. The pause  key you define is in  addition to the
	 CTRL-P key which  is automatically defined. The default
	 key assignments are:

			UP : Up key on cursor key pad.
		      DOWN : Down key on cursor key pad.
		      LEFT : Left key on cursor key pad.
		     RIGHT : Right key on cursor key pad.
		      BOMB : "X" key.
	       FIRE BULLET : SPACE bar.
		     PAUSE : ESC key.

	Adjust Display.

	 This option allows  you to center the screen and choose
	 from  the  two avaliable color  pallettes.  Center  the
	 screen by   using the	cursor key  pad arrow  keys  and
	 change the pallette  by using the "P"  key. Press ENTER
	 when done to save the values to disk.

	Reset High Score List.

	 This option clears the high score table for the current
	 skill level. The write protect tab must be off the disk
	 in order for this to work.
