How to prepare sound loop in the CoolEdit editor:

To ensure continuity of start and end of the loop, the loop length
must be a multiple of the frame size. You can either use the MP3 player
from the examples to find the frame size, or compile this program with
the DISP_FRAMEINFO switch. You need a "FrameTime" entry indicating the
frame interval in microseconds.

Sample loops in this directory have format Bitrate=80kbps, Samprate=32kHz,
Stereo, with FrameTime=36000us (36ms). You must adjust the track length to
a multiple of 36ms.

Example of the procedure in Cooledit:
- The default track "3xOSC fun.wav" has a length of 8.807 seconds and a 44100 Hz stereo format.
- Required new length of the track is: 8.807/0.036=244.64. Nearest integer=245 frames.
  New length will be 245*0.036=8.820 seconds.
- Use function Effects/Time-Pitch/Stretch, select Stretching mode "Resample".
  Enter required new length 8.820 seconds.
- Convert to target frequency 32000 Hz stereo, function Edit/Convert_Sample_Type.
- Save loop to the file 001.MP3 in MP3 format. Select destination format
  "80 Kbps, 32000 Hz, Stereo" in Options, CBR constant bitrate, MP3 version.
- Close file and open saved MP3 file again, to check it. As you can see, length is now
  8.892 seconds. Cooledit added two silent frames. You can see one FadeIn frame at the
  beginning of the file, and a second FadeOut frame at the end of the file,
  both about 0.036 seconds long.

If you are using another editor that does not automatically add FadeIn and FadeOut frames,
you must do so manually by inserting 0.036 second silence sections at the beginning
and end of the file. These frames will be omitted during playback.
